# UniStatsBank
 An RShiny app that generates descriptive graphics on Singaporean and American universities based on user input, helping users to shortlist potential courses or universities.
 
 # Purpose:
I created a user-friendly, straightforward website where students can easily read up important facts about the university courses that they are interested in. Based on personal experience, I realised that numerous online websites that compare universities are often cluttered with advertisements and miscellaneous facts, or use technical terms that I do not really understand, so I hope that my wesbite will address these issues.

# Troubleshooting/Future Developments: 
Would be open to any feedback or future improvements to my website if I can find the relevant data, so do reach out! :)
